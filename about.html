        <h1>Who Am I</h1>
        <p>Originally from Mumbai, India, I spent 22 years in my hometown before moving to the United States to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. <br><br>Academically, my journey started with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering from K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, where I developed a strong interest in Web and Mobile Development, setting the foundation for my professional pursuits. I have gained substantial experience across programming, web development, and data science, with skills spanning Python, R programming, JavaScript, and web development frameworks such as MERN Stack and React. <br><br>In my professional career, I have worked as a Technical Intern at Galaxy Office Automation, where I contributed to developing secure APIs using PHP, MySQL, and implemented JWT-based authorization, as well as managing PostgreSQL databases. I’ve also worked on mobile applications, including a survey app aimed at improving accessibility across Mumbai’s railway stations.<br><br>I have led a number of academic projects, from building a real-time chat application using the MERN stack, to developing a sign language recognition system leveraging OpenCV and Keras. One of my favorite projects was creating a personalized e-learning system using K-means clustering and reinforcement learning to tailor content to individual learning preferences.<br><br>In summary, I'm a Full Stack developer, with a keen eye for creating engaging UI and bringing designs to life.</p>
